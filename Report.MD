# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing smartphone sales performance and product features using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to transform a raw dataset into meaningful business insights through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.

The analysis evaluates how brands, models, and technical features such as battery capacity, processor speed, RAM, NFC, IR Blaster, and 5G support influence sales performance.

# Project Objective

The primary objective of this analysis was to:

- Prepare and clean raw sales data for accurate analysis

- Explore patterns and trends in smartphone sales

- Analyze product features and their impact on performance

- Compare sales against performance metrics

- Present insights using pivot tables and visualizations

# Business Questions Addressed

- Which smartphone brands and models generate the highest sales?

- How do sales performance ratios vary by brand?

- Which smartphone features contribute most to higher sales?

 - Is there a relationship between technical performance (battery, RAM, processor speed) and sales?

- What percentage of smartphones support features like 5G, NFC, and IR Blaster?

- Tools & Techniques Used

- Microsoft Excel

- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)

- Pivot Tables

- Excel Charts & Visualizations

- Basic Correlation Analysis

# Data Preparation & Cleaning

The dataset was initially reviewed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Key Cleaning Steps:

- Removed empty rows and irrelevant records

- Corrected sorting and alignment issues

- Standardized column headers for uniformity

- Ensured unique naming conventions for brands and models

- Removed duplicates and resolved data errors

- Converted data types using Excel formulas where necessary

- Power Query was used extensively to streamline the cleaning and transformation process.
